This was my first ever project working with React and even first project done with JavaScript! I have created an onepagewebsite that contains a short filmblog. I have used XMLfile as a database so I have learned how to parse the file and display the context on the website. I have created this project using visual studio code. once you download the folder. you should first change your directory to "cd filmblog" on your new terminal, then install npm "npm install" then initiate the website by "npm start". The localhost:3000 tab will open up immediately showing the context of the website if not you could type localhost:3000 on your preferred web browser to get the same effect. Also I have removed my API key from the Navigation part, if you have an API key for google news you should copy and paste it "YOURAPIKEY" section in the Navigation.js file. below is an insturction from the React app which will help you to understand more about how to operate the process. Thank you!



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
